> Yes, It Actually Works

Most WordPress anti spam tools amount to garbage, both built in to WordPress, and third party plugins. The built in tools are mediocre, and at best force you to babysit new comments and registrations.

On the other hand, third party plugins are all over the map. Many make your real, interested readers jump through hoops to sign up and/or leave comments on your site, assuming they are that patient.

Others simply don’t work anymore, and you are left reacting to spam invasions. Things shouldn’t be this way, and there’s a reason those plugins don’t work: they’re built on the wrong idea.

Spam must be defended against, right? Wrong. Spam hurts the invaluable image of your business and saps your time – your anti spam must violently fight to destroy the Spammers, not defend against them.

Don’t take the lead and Spammers will walk over you. That’s why Spam Hammer works: it takes the fight to them, instead of waiting for them to bring it to you. Don't take my word for it -- see

What Others Say

> 3 Types of Spammers

Spammers generally fall into 3 categories. The first type offers "SEO" services to unsuspecting site owners at seemingly reasonable costs, promising X links to their clients' sites and high search rankings.

The second type of Spammer advertises for an ad network, similar to Google Adwords, or a marketplace, like Amazon or Clickbank. They pay Spammers for clicks, and advertisers/product sellers pay them.

The third type of Spammer sells physical products directly through small sites of their own or hacked sites. They sell trending counterfeit luxury handbags, footwear, clothes, and other retail items.

> Be The Aggressor

Spammers spend money blast your site with an end goal of a profit. If they first fail, they hire a person solve whatever captcha or antispam you’re running. If even that fails, attacking you is a net loss.

If it happens once or twice, the Spammer only loses fractions of a penny.  But, the costs compound as more take action.  By being aware of this and acting intelligently, you're in the position of the aggressor.

You might think that's a stretch. But, think about it again: instead of thinking "how do I stop spammers", you think "how do I hurt spammers". Stopping Spammers then comes automatically. It's a BIG shift.

Seeing this threat, and after a string of failed attacks, Spammers try to pick apart Spam Hammer. It's on the cloud so they can’t. Knowing they are helpless, some email me swear words in broken English.

Spam Hammer attacks for you hands-free in many different ways, not bothering real visitors and readers. The biggest of it's many ways are: 1. Geo blocking 2. Wasting their time and 3. Going above their heads.

> 1. Uncommon Sense: Geo Blocking

Most spam is made on computers outside the home country of your site. Some countries tacitly permit spamming, while others like Bulgaria are safe havens for big spam services due to the country’s laws.

If you run a local business in the USA, why would you accept comments from computers in Ukraine?As you know, sometimes, common sense isn't so common. There is no reason to accept those comments.

Spam Hammer provides both country and continent blocking, so while those blocked can visit you, they can't comment or register. This is very aggressive against big spammers, who have location limitations.

Popular spamming countries are blocked out of the box, but you can change these at anytime. If it's not practical to block geographically, the other features work perfectly fine without this.

> 2. Revenge: Wasting Their Time

Spammers perversely expose themselves to tens of thousands of sites, so the amount of time they spend blasting one can’t stretch too long. 5 seconds spent on each of 10,000 sites is over half a day.

What if I told you this is a major risk factor for Spammers, beyond IP blacklisting? What if visitors had to wait 15 seconds before posting a comment? What if real readers weren’t bothered by it, only Spammers?

Where a real visitor would read the page, scroll down, then fill out a comment, Spammers would instantly try to jam in a comment, making it easy to catch them – real visitors 100% unharmed.

This would cause Spam programs to desperately and repeatedly try to figure out why spam isn’t going through, when there is no captcha or question on the page. Spam Hammer adds this timer.

> 3. Going Above Their Heads

Spam comments always link to external sites. Many links are cloaked so you can’t see the real site until you click the cloaked link and get redirected. Why the secrecy, if you'd see the real site anyway?

It's simple: they fear retribution. But from who, if not you? In truth, they are scared you’d discover who 1. they are 2. who's above their heads.  It risks termination of their activities and can tank their profits.

> Never Again

Never again will your real readers' comments be recognized as spam, leaving them wondering if the content they took the time to write on your site even reached the other end.

Never again will they contact you and ask you “why”. Never again will readers lose the pleasure of commenting on your site, and instead spread the word about your site having spam problems.

Never again will you get hundreds of emails about spam comments in your queue, awaiting you to pick out the one or two comments that are real and mass deleting the rest, over and over.

Never again will already registered, legitimate readers, including administrators, be blocked from posting after it’s stupidly clear they're not Spammers.
