== Description ==

> _"I've always had a problem with Spam - I'd tried every plugin out there, as well as every default feature to keep them at bay but nothing worked as well as I'd hoped, and recently our spam attacks hit a new level, where I needed to moderate everything manually - an exhaustive and time consuming process with 10 spam to every 1 human.  Since installing this and disabling every other feature - I've not had one instance of spam.  Unbelievable.  Thank you very much."_

Install with a simple download and activate -- no setup required.  You can comfortably try the service and contribute back to it as a license owner after using it for some days.

> Yes, It Actually Works

Most WordPress anti spam tools amount to garbage, both built in to WordPress, and third party plugins. The built in tools are mediocre, and at best force you to babysit new comments and registrations.

On the other hand, third party plugins are all over the map. Many make your real, interested readers jump through hoops to sign up and/or leave comments on your site, assuming they are that patient.

Others simply don’t work anymore, and you are left reacting to spam invasions. Things shouldn’t be this way, and there’s a reason those plugins don’t work: they’re built on the wrong idea.

Spam must be defended against, right? Wrong. Spam hurts the invaluable image of your business and saps your time – and your anti spam must violently fight to destroy the Spammers, not defend against them.

If you don’t take the initiative, Spammers walk over you. That’s why Spam Hammer is the best WordPress spam blocker: it takes the fight to spammers, instead of waiting for them to bring it to you.

There were many others in a situation similar to yours, who chose to try a tool that fights back. See what other business owners and professionals that tried Spam Hammer say.

> Flip The Script, Be The Aggressor

Spammers have things to protect as well – things they consider precious and valuable. If you hit them where it hurts, Spammers run in the other direction and look for their next target.

What is precious to Spammers? To know this, you must know that the spam they put out isn’t sent directly by them; it’s sent through a service they pay for, and expect to get a ROI from.

Spammers spend money trying to blast your site, and if that fails, they hire a person solve whatever captcha or antispam you’re running. If even that fails, the Spammer spent that money – for nothing.

If it happens once or twice, the Spammer only loses a few cents. But, if they continue to fail, the costs become significant. It’s like your site is surrounded by a spiked shield. They then scratch off your site.

When the owners of spamming services notice this pattern, they attempt to reverse engineer the anti spam. When they can’t, as with Spam Hammer, they lose customers and email us nasty words ;)

Spam Hammer has several ways to fight for you hands-free, and the most overt among these are 1. Geo blocking 2. Reverse time sink and 3. Ad network slap.

> 1. Geo Blocking: Common Sense

Most spam is made on computers outside the home country of your site. Some countries tacitly permit spamming, while others like Bulgaria are safe havens for big spam services due to the country’s laws.

If you run a local business in the USA, why would you accept comments from computers in Ukraine? There is no reason, and by blocking them, you block all spammers from that country automatically.

Spam Hammer provides both country and continent blocking. This is especially aggressive against spam services – they can’t just pack up and go to another country, and are helpless against this.

By default, popular spamming countries are blocked, but you can change these at any time to fit you.

> 2. Reverse Time Sink: An eye for an eye

Spammers enjoy the luxury of being able to click “spam” and blast your site within seconds; over the following seconds, their spam program moves to the other innocent targets and hits them.

Spammers perversely expose themselves to tens of thousands of sites, so the amount of time they spend blasting one can’t stretch too long.

What if I told you this is a major risk factor for them, far beyond blacklisting? What if visitors had to wait 15 seconds before posting a comment? What if real readers weren’t bothered by it, only Spammers?

Spam Hammer adds this feature to your site. By the time real readers finish loading and reading your page or post, and scroll down to write a comment, way more than 15 seconds have gone by.

In a rush to move on, Spammers ignore the required 15 seconds, try to jam in a comment way before the timer is up, and make it super easy to catch them – all without touching a single legitimate reader.

This causes Spammers to run around like chickens with their heads cut off, trying to figure out why their spam isn’t going through after multiple attempts when there is no captcha on the page.

The optimal timer is 15 seconds long and this is something that generally doesn’t have to be adjusted; though, you do have the option to raise or lower this to what suits you.

> 3. Ad Network Slap a.k.a. Uncloaking

Spam comments always link to one or more sites. Many links are cloaked so you can’t see the actual site until you click the cloaked link are redirected to the real one. And, Spammers aren’t only hiding it from you.

Why do Spammers go through the trouble of cloaking their links? In truth, they are scared you’d discover “why”: 1. fear of termination by Ad Networks, and/or 2. fear of penalties by Google.

Spammers’ cloaked links redirect to an Ad Network’s site. Spammers use the cloak links to cover their tracks so the Ad Network won’t know where the click came from, and then pocket a commission for that dirty click.

Most Ad Networks actually prohibit this in their terms of service. Imagine you’re a site owner paying for all of these clicks that aren’t converting. The Ad Network loses a customer and gets bad word of mouth.

Without cloaking, Ad Networks can log suspicious activity. When the Spammer is reported to the Ad Network, they can then terminate the Spammer’s account and seize their funds.

Spam Hammer automatically uncloaks and records these links for reporting. You won’t find many cases where it’s beneficial to allow link cloaking on your site, so all links, spam and ham, are uncloaked.

> Never Again

Never again will your real readers' comments be recognized as spam, leaving them wondering if the content they took the time to write on your site even reached the other end.

Never again will they contact you and ask you “why”. Never again will readers lose the pleasure of commenting on your site, and instead spreading the word about your site having problems.

Never again will you get hundreds of emails about spam comments in your queue, awaiting you to pick out the one or two comments that are real and mass deleting the rest, over and over.

Never again will already registered, legitimate readers, including administrators, be blocked from posting after it’s stupidly clear they are not spammers.

Never again will you run an impotent anti spam solution with endless confusing settings or setup that requires technical skills that aren’t in your reach as a busy professional.
