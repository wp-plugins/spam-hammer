> _Smashes Spam Comments, Trackbacks, & Registrations (and anything else, with the Tailor add-on) in 31 Languages_

What if... you woke up in the morning, logged into your website, check for email notifications... and spam wasn't there.

What if, you could see real comments, real content, real signups... real activity... not endless pages of spam.

What if you had more time in your day, to focus on getting more traffic.  More time to sharpen your search engine rankings.



What if your website wasn't under the threat of being terminated instantly without any warning, for no apparent reason.

What if you didn't miss opportunities for website growth, because you were too busy trying to catch up to Spammers.

What if you didn't have to worry about babysitting new content for eternity, afraid that most of it is spam.

> _Yes, Most Anti-spam Is Garbage_

Most WordPress anti-spam tools, both built in and third party, are impotent, you know this from personal experience.

Most make your real, interested traffic jump through hoops to share content on your site, stealing your natural growth.

Most simply don't work, are complex, made by unreliable coders, and waste your time as you shuffle through them.



About two years ago in my software consultancy, at the request of a client, I made an anti-spam plugin.

It was simple and effective; so effective, that my client asked me to release the plugin to the public, and I obliged.

Things were going well for many months, until Spammers saw the plugin and reverse-engineered it.  It was time to fight back.

> _Fighting Back_

With the help of some clients, I launched a premium cloud version that was completely immune to reverse engineering.

I then worked to make it invisible to end-users, lightning fast, able of protect every form, not just comments and registrations.

My clients were raving about it, and it <i>was</i> up to $97/yr to use.  <b>I now 100% pay for your 1st website, <u>even if it's commercial</u>.</b>

> _[See what others say](http://www.wpspamhammer.com/testimonials)_

A few months ago, the owner of a spam network sent me an email with curses in broken English.  I was hurting their business.

I then realized that the best way to deal with Spammers isn't to defend against them.  It's better to attack <i>them</i>.

Not by attacking them back with Spam, but by attacking their wallets.  That is the philosophy Spam Hammer is built upon.

Starting from 4.1.2 onwards, WooCommerce, Contact Form 7 and Gravity Forms compatibility is built in without the Tailor add-on.

> _Jessi says: "Before Spam Hammer, my blog/website was becoming overrun with spam comments. I couldn't get anything done because I had 500+ comments to go through & moderate every time I logged on to my site . I tried everything, captcha, math equations, every plugin I could find to relieve some of the spam, and  NOTHING helped.  The day I tried Spam Hammer, everything changed, it was amazing so easy to use and exceptional at getting through the spam.  I LOVE logging on to  seeing the massive number of blocked spam attempts, as well as the chart of how many attempts per hour."_
