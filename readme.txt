I couldn't get anything done because I had 500+ comments to go through & moderate every time I logged on to my site . I tried everything, captcha, math equations, every plugin I could find to relieve some of the spam, and  NOTHING helped.  The day I tried Spam Hammer, everything changed, it was amazing so easy to use and exceptional at getting through the spam.  I LOVE logging on to  seeing the massive number of blocked spam attempts, as well as the chart of how many attempts per hour."_
