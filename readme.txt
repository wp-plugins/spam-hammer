Spam Hammer is an aggressive, premium anti-spam service for WordPress that repels Spammers from your website's forms.

It works by intercepting spam long before it reaches you, without interrupting real traffic.  No moderation, no captchas.

I 100% finance your use on the first website, even if it's commercial; you pay nothing out of pocket to start.

> _Jessi says: "Before Spam Hammer, my blog/website was becoming overrun with spam comments. I couldn't get anything done because I had 500+ comments to go through & moderate every time I logged on to my site . I tried everything, captcha, math equations, every plugin I could find to relieve some of the spam, and  NOTHING helped.  The day I tried Spam Hammer, everything changed, it was amazing so easy to use and exceptional at getting through the spam.  I LOVE logging on to  seeing the massive number of blocked spam attempts, as well as the chart of how many attempts per hour."_
